Take a dash of PDP-11 instructions, while borrowing some of its registers, 
and add in a few other made up things. What do you get? This. This stuff.

## The goal
While away my waking hours keeping myself amused.

## What?
Oh right. Building this "thing". You'll need `clang` and `make`.
Armed with those tools, run the following:

```
make all
```

You'll end up with a newly created `bin/` directory containing this stuff.
