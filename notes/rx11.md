# RX11 Floppy Disk System

- Stores 256256 8-bit bytes.
- 77 tracks and 26 sectors per track.
    - Each sector 128 8-bit bytes.

## Registers

### RXCS (777170)

#### BIT 0 : GO
Initiates a command to RX01. **Write-only**

#### BIT 1 - 3 : Function Select
Eight possible functions:

    CODE
    000     Fill Buffer
    001     Empty Buffer
    010     Write Sector
    011     Read Sector
    100     NOT USED
    101     Read Status
    110     Write Deleted Data Sector
    111     Read Error Register

#### BIT 4 : Unit Select
Select one of two possible disks. **Write-only**

#### BIT 5 : Done
Indicates completion of a function.
Will generate an interrupt if BIT 6 is set. **Read-only**

#### BIT 6 : Interrupt Enable
Set by program to enable an interrupt when
RX01 has completed an op (Done).

Bit is cleared by Initialize (BIT 14)

#### BIT 7 : Transfer Request
Signifies RX11 needs data or has data. **Read-only**

#### BIT 8-13 : Unused

#### BIT 14 : RX11 Initialize
Set to initialize the RX11, without initializing
all of the devices on UNIBUS. **Write-only**

#### BIT 15 : Error
Set to indicate error has occurred.
Cleared on initiation of new command or Initialize. **Read-only**

### RXDB (777172) Data Buffer
General purpose data path between RX01 and interface.
May represent one of four RX01 registers.

If RX01 is executing a command, will only accept data
if RXCS bit 7 is set. Valid data can only be read when
RXCS bit 7 is set.
